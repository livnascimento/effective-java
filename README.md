# Effective Java Practice Projects

This repository contains practical, self-contained Java projects based on the concepts and best practices presented in *Effective Java* by Joshua Bloch.

Each folder represents an independent Java project demonstrating the application of a specific item from the book. The goal is to reinforce understanding through real, runnable examples and encourage writing robust, maintainable, and efficient Java code.
